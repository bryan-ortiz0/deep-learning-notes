# 01 Introduction

AI faces a significant challenge in tackling tasks that are effortless for humans but challenging to formally describe. These are intuitive problems, like recognizing words or faces in images, which we do automatically.\


To address this challenge, the solution is to enable computers to learn from experience and comprehend the world through a hierarchy of concepts. Each concept is defined in relation to simpler ones. This approach avoids the requirement for humans to explicitly specify all the necessary knowledge. The hierarchy allows computers to learn complex concepts by constructing them from simpler ones. This approach is known as <mark style="color:green;">deep learning</mark>.
